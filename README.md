## Sprite Grid

Sprite Grid is a grid based level editor made in Swift and Sprite Kit.

#### How it works

1) open the project in Xcode<br>
2) import your assets in the Assets folder<br>
3) include your assets in the ElementsProperties.plist file<br>

#### TODO

- grid size is currently fixed, it should be dynamic<br>
- there should be a way to export the generated files from within the app<br>
- there should be a way to import assets<br>
