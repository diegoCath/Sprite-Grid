### Sprite Grid

Sprite Grid is a grid based level editor made in Swift and Sprite Kit.

# How it works

1) open the project in Xcode
2) import your assets in the Assets folder
3) include your assets in the ElementsProperties.plist file

# TODO

- grid size is currently fixed, it should be dynamic
- there should be a way to export the generated files from within the app
- there should be a way to import assets
